This project is a small sbt project that gives you an opportunity to write [docile-charge-point](https://github.com/NewMotion/docile-charge-point) scripts with autocomplete in IntelliJ IDEA.

Just open [TestScript.scala](src/main/scala/TestScript.scala) and start editing where it says `// INSERT SCRIPT HERE`.
