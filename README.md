# docile-charge-point

A scriptable OCPP charge point simulator.

Not as continuously ill-tempered as
[abusive-charge-point](https://github.com/chargegrid/abusive-charge-point), but
it can be mean if you script it to be.

## TODOs

 * Make it able to take both Central System and Charge Point roles
 
 * Add a DSL that needs no for comprehensions (using mutable state a la specs2?)
 
 * Allow run-time loading of text files with scripts

 * Make it able to simulate many charge point at once

 * Make it produce TAP output or something that makes it easy to integrate it in
   a CI test
